> The publish/subscribe paradigm offers many advantages for communication in unstructured decentralized peer-to-peer networks. One of the models that fit into this paradigm is topic-based event dissemination. This paper presents an agent-based system for publish/subscribe inspired by TERA and implemented on top of JADE. We describe the system’s design and implementation and show several performance results obtained in a real-life setting.
